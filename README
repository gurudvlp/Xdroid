Xdroid is a remote control for your Linux box for Android devices. It logs in securely, and displays the remote desktop 
on your phone or tablet. You can switch work spaces, manipulate windows, and make your computer do magic without ever 
touching the keyboard or mouse.

Xdroid can be used with multiple window managers, and can be used over the internet from remote locations. So far, it has 
been tested with xfwm, Compiz and Xmonad. Feel free to update me if you get it to work properly with other window managers.

Dependencies:

    php5-cli

    scrot
    xautomation
    xdotool
    wmctrl

Mar 17, 2012:
The newest version of Xdroid contains the server-side scripts as a resource in the APK package file, so you will only need 
to download that one file. I have also introduced a TrackPad mode that allows you to use the touch screen on your phone or 
tablet as a track pad similar to a laptop's. Mouse movement is relative, and you are fully able to click, right click, and 
scroll.
